# Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Project 5

This is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. I then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Application
You can see 5 markers on the map when you first launch the app. You can use search functionality to filter and onyl display places you would like to see. You can click on the marker to get more data about a place.

The site is responsive and can run on any device.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used to show markers and places on the map.
Foursquare API is used to fetch data about selected places.

## Installation
Clone or download this repo and open the index.html file on your browser.
